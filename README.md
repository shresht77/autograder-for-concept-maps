# autograder-for-concept-maps


Concept mapping is a well-known pedagogical tool to help students organize, represent, and develop an understanding of a topic. The grading of concept maps is typically manual, time-consuming, and tedious, especially for a large class. Existing research mostly focuses on topological scoring based-on structural features of concept maps. Unfortunately, the scoring does not achieve comparable accuracy to well-defined rubrics for manual analysis on the quality of content in a concept map. This script automates the Waterloo rubric of scoring concept maps by quantifing the rubric's quality assessment parameters.
